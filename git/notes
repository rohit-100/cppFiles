undo things

    
    quickly save local changes(unstaged)

        command             git stash

        work    
            used to save the current work and allow to move in different branch

            if you have uncommited works then you can not switch to different branch.

            what stash does, it saves all the newly added codes after the last commit and make 
            it like as of after last commit , now you can move to different branch and do somechanges 
            as normally we do with branches ,

            after returning to previous branch we can run " git stash pop " to undo the changes 



    staged  local changes(means we have ran the command "git add <files>")

        command     git reset HEAD <file> 
                        
                           unstage the file to current commit
                    git reset 
                            
                            unstage everything , retain changes

                    git stash
                            
                            discard all local changes but save them for later

                    git reset --hard

                            discard everything permanently
