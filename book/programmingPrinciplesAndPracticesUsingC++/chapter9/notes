9.1  
    a class is a user defined type that specifies how objects are represented , how objects are created and how they are used and how they
    are destroyed.



9.3
    public interface is what the user's view of class
    private interface is what the implementer's view of class


9.4
    with writting member function inside class
        1. The function will be inlined,(the compiler will generate code without using a fucntion call) , a performance boost
        2. if something is changed inside class declaration body then all usues of the class will have to be recompiled.(loss of performance)


    so rule of thumb:
        Don't put member function bodies in the class declaration unless you know you need the performance boost from inlining
        tiny function.
