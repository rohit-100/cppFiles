/*You are given with a n digit lock. Your task is to break the lock. You are given with the starting sequence and the ending sequence. 
 * There are certain lock configurations that are said to be the deadlock. If you are stuck in that sequence, the lock is locked forever 
 * and you can not proceed further. You are given with K deadlock configurations. In one second, you can change one digit of the lock either 
 * up or down. So, if the digit is 3, you can make it 2 or 4 in one second. The lock is circular, which means 0 can be changed to 9 and vice 
 * versa in one second. Your task is to find the minimum time in which the lock can be broken.*/
