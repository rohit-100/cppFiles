1. inline functions 
   
   all member function defined inside the class definition are by default
        inline. but we can make any non_class function inline by using keyword inline

        inline functions are actual functions , which are copied everywhere during compilation,like preprocessor macro,
            so overhead of function calling is reduced

    
    declaring a friend function is a way to give private access to non-member function

2. copy constuctor
    a copy constructor creates a new object,which is exact copy of the existing object.The compiler provides a default
        copy constructor to all the classes
    
        class-name (class-name &){}
        class-name (const class-name& )const {}

3. modes of inheritance
    public mode (all access modifier are as it is in child class)
    protected mode(public members of base class is converted in protected mode)
    private mode (all members are private of base class)



4. virtual keyword in multiple inheritance
    if two members are same in base classes and we want to inherit both the classes the we have to use virutal keyword
        to prohibit confusion.

5. polymorphism
    compile time
        1. methode ovverloading
        2. operator overloading
    runtime 
        1. virtual functions
